3.1 make a branch with "git branch mybranch"

What's changed in .git/refs?  Has .git/HEAD changed?

3.2 check out the branch with "git checkout mybranch"

Has .git/HEAD changed? Use "git checkout" to switch between "mybranch" and "master" a few times.

3.4 make non-overlapping changes in the different branches.

Watch the underlying changes. Run gitg or gitk to see your changes.

3.5 merge

Change to the master branch, then run "git merge mybranch".
Commit the merge.  What does gitg/gitk show?

3.6 delete the branch

$ git branch -d mybranch

Now what does gitg/gitk show?
