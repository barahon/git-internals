1. Make a directory, cd into it, and create the repo.

$ mkdir /tmp/$LOGNAME; cd $_; git init

This creates a git repository.
What's there?
Use "tree -a" to inspect the contents.

2. Add a file.

$ touch README
$ git add .

What's changed? [Hint: use "tree -a"]
Use "git cat-file -p e69d" to show the contents.

3. Now commit it.

$ git commit -m"initial"

What's changed?  What are the new objects?

4. Add another file

$ touch foo
$ git add .

What's changed?  Why?
What does "git status" say?
