Run git-show. If the SHA1 of your latest commit is DDNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN, type
"ls .git/objects/DD/*"

cd .git/objects/DD and try these:
  git cat-file -t *
  git cat-file -p *

Use these commands on the other files in .git/objects .  How are they related?

Look at the actual contents of these files with cat, or your favorite editor. What does "file" say they are?
