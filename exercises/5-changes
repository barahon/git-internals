Clone hello_d.git to a scratch repo and cd into it.

Prepend the shebang line "#!/bin/bash" to "hello" Does wc report exactly 2 lines and 30 characters?

Add and commit this change.  Can you use git cat-file to find and examine both blobs in .git/objects/?

Run "ls -l" on both blobs.  Has the original blob changed?

Use "ls -l" and "git cat-file" on the other objects. Do they make sense?

Delete the scratch repo and re-clone to make another.

This time, copy "hello" to "goodbye" .  Add and commit the new file.  Now can you find both blobs?  Why not? [Hint: try git hash-object on both "hello" and "goodbye".]

Has anything changed under .git/objects?  Why?
